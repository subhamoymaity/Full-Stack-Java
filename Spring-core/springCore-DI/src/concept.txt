💉 1. What is IoC (Inversion of Control)?
🌟 IoC is a principle where control of object creation and dependency management is transferred from the
developer to the framework (like Spring).
example:
In Java: Instead of doing this manually:
Car car = new Car(new Engine());
Spring will manage this automatically.


💉 2. What is Dependency Injection (DI)?
🌟 DI is a design pattern used to implement IoC, where the dependencies are injected (provided) by the framework instead of the class creating them.

🔧 Types of DI in Spring:
Constructor DI	Dependencies are passed via constructor
Setter DI	Dependencies are set via setter method
Field DI	Dependencies injected directly into fields (with @Autowired)


💉 3. What is IoC Container? (The Spring engine room )⚙️ ---  Mnemonic

🌟 The IoC Container is the core part of Spring that manages
Bean creation
Bean lifecycle
Bean injection

🔥 Main IoC Containers in Spring:
    BeanFactory	     Basic container (lazy loading)
    ApplicationContext	    Advanced container (eager loading, more features)

🔥 Difference Between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext
Feature	              BeanFactory	                                          ApplicationContext
Lazy Initialization	  ✅ Yes (creates bean on demand)	            ❌ No (creates all singleton beans at start)
Advanced Features	  ❌ No	                                        ✅ Yes (AOP, Events, i18n, etc.)
Use Case	           Lightweight apps, testing	                Most common in real-world apps

💡singleton: Only one object (instance) of that bean is created in the entire Spring container —
    no matter how many times you call getBean() for it.
    advantage : Saves memory and reduces object creation overhead.
💡Singleton : create one object for multiple request.
In Spring Boot, we mostly use:
ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(App.class, args);

ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("bean.xml");  also in spring

ApplicationContext	                IoC container interface (super powerful, advanced)
ClassPathXmlApplicationContext	    Implementation class of ApplicationContext
"Beans.xml"	                        Path of your Spring config XML file (bean definitions)

->  In Spring, the IoC container creates and injects objects by reading the bean.xml file —
the injection is handled by the Spring Framework, not manually by the developer. ✅

💉 What actually is a Bean in Spring?
A Spring Bean is just a Java object that is managed by the Spring IoC container.

So, when you tell Spring about a class (via bean.xml, @Component, @Bean, etc.), Spring:

Creates an object (instantiates it)
Manages its lifecycle (creation, initialization, destruction)
Injects its dependencies (via constructor, setter, or field)
Gives it to you when needed

🔁 Summary of Flow:
Spring creates the petrolEngine bean
It creates the car bean
It injects petrolEngine into car via setEngine()
You fetch car from Spring and call car.drive()



You typically use one of these attributes in 🔁  <constructor-arg>:

Attribute	    Use Case Example
ref	            Reference to another bean
value	        Pass literal values (String, int, etc.)
index	        Specify position of argument (e.g., 0, 1, ...)
type	        Specify argument type (e.g., org.example.IEngine)
name	        (Less common, requires compiler to retain names)

<constructor-arg index="0" ref="petrol" />
<!-- OR -->
<constructor-arg type="org.example.IEngine" ref="petrol" />



💉 What is a Bean Scope?
In Spring, when you define a bean, Spring decides:
❓ "How many objects (instances) of this bean should I create?"
This decision is controlled by Bean Scope.

🔁 Types of Bean Scopes (For Spring Core - Standalone App)
1. singleton	    Only one object per Spring container (default)
2. prototype	    Creates a new object every time it is requested
3. request (Spring MVC/Web Only)
4. session (Spring MVC/Web Only)
