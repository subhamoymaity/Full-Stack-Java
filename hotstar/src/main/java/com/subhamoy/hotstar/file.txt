question:-------
watchlist is working properlly in frontend -  . but when i writting the
url in chrome- http://localhost:8080/api/watchlist . not working . strange

answer--------------
🔍 What's Happening:
Image 1 (Frontend - Works ✅):
Frontend at localhost:5173/watchlist
Shows "Interstellar" in your watchlist
Why it works: React app sends JWT token automatically via axios interceptor
Image 2 (Direct Browser Access - Fails ❌):
Direct URL: http://localhost:8080/api/watchlist
Returns "403 Forbidden"
Why it fails: Browser doesn't send JWT token
💡 Why This Happens:
Frontend Request (Works):
JavaScript
// Your React app does this:
axios.get('/watchlist')
// ↓
// Axios interceptor adds token automatically:
Headers: {
  Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...
}
// ↓
// Backend sees token → Allows access ✅
Browser Request (Fails):
Code
You type: http://localhost:8080/api/watchlist
Browser sends: Plain GET request
Headers: {
  // NO Authorization header!
}
↓
Backend: No token → 403 Forbidden ❌
🎯 This is Actually GOOD!
This proves your security is working correctly:

✅ Protected endpoints require authentication
✅ Random people can't access your watchlist
✅ Only authenticated users (with valid JWT tokens) can access

🧪 How to Test Backend URL Directly:
If you want to test the backend URL in the browser, you have 2 options:

Option 1: Use Postman (Recommended)
Open Postman
GET http://localhost:8080/api/watchlist
Headers:
Key: Authorization
Value: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
Send ✅
How to get your token:

In your React app, press F12 (Console)
Type: localStorage.getItem('token')
Copy the token
Use in Postman

🤔 Good Question! Why 3 Different Platforms?
✅ Yes, It's NORMAL & Actually BETTER! Here's Why:
🎯 Industry Standard (Real Companies Do This):
Code
Netflix:
├── Frontend: AWS CloudFront + S3
├── Backend: AWS EC2 / Kubernetes
└── Database: AWS RDS + Cassandra

Uber:
├── Frontend: AWS CloudFront
├── Backend: Google Cloud + AWS
└── Database: MySQL + PostgreSQL + Redis

Your Project:
├── Frontend: Vercel  ✅
├── Backend: Render   ✅
└── Database: PlanetScale  ✅
This is called "Microservices Architecture" - Each component is independent!

💡 Why Separate Platforms is BETTER:
Benefit	Explanation
🎯 Best Tool for Each Job	Vercel is #1 for React, Render is great for Spring Boot
💰 Maximum Free Resources	Each platform gives free tier - you get 3x more!
🔒 Security	If one crashes, others still work
📈 Scalability	Scale each part independently
🎓 Resume Impact	Shows you know multiple platforms (bonus points!)
