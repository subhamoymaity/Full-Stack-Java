@RequestMapping, @GetMapping  , @postMapping is the functionality of rest api  with spring boot

Actually we are designing  rest api with Spring boot .

@getMapping do serialization and also  maps the method with http(Postman) get method .
serialization  is done by SpringBoot.


@RequestBody tells that take Json data and converts it in java object (deserialization) ,
and the Json will come by @postMapping   annotation

 @postMapping maps the method with http post method
