all will come and registry them here

Why we write

eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false
(in Service Registry application.properties)
👉 Very short:
Because the Service Registry (Eureka Server) should NOT register itself as a client.



Service Registry (Eureka Server) – Work (Very short)

Acts like a phone directory for microservices
Other services register themselves here
Stores service name + IP + port
Helps services find and talk to each other without hard-coding URLs

In one line
register-with-eureka=false → “I am the registry, not a client.”
Service Registry → “I keep track of all microservices.”
